# Depth First Search (DFS)

Graph traversal algorithm that utilizes a stack in order to recursively 
explore a graph in depth, similar to a 'pre-order' traversal of a binary tree.

Basic rundown:
-Select a starting node
-Make a set of nodes adjacent to current node
-Visit each node in adjacent set and recursively repeat the previous step
-Mark each visited node (make a visited set) so you don't revisit
